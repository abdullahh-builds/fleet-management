╚════════════════════════════════════════╝

========================================
  BENCHMARK 1: SEARCH PERFORMANCE
========================================

📊 Test Data Size: 1000 vehicles

Searching for: V10000
  Hash Table O(1): 0 μs
  Linear Search O(n): 0 μs
Searching for: V10500
  Hash Table O(1): 0 μs
  Linear Search O(n): 40 μs
  ⚡ Hash Table is infx FASTER!

Searching for: V10999
  Hash Table O(1): 0 μs
  Linear Search O(n): 119 μs
  ⚡ Hash Table is infx FASTER!

✅ Hash Table consistently delivers O(1) performance!
✅ Linear search degrades with position (worst case at end)


========================================
  BENCHMARK 2: BINARY SEARCH vs LINEAR
========================================

📊 Test Data Size: 10000 vehicles

Searching for: V29500 (middle position)

Binary Search O(log n): 3 μs
Linear Search O(n): 966 μs
⚡ Binary Search is 322x FASTER!

✅ Binary Search scales logarithmically!
✅ For 10,000 items: log₂(10000) ≈ 13 comparisons


========================================
  BENCHMARK 3: HEAP vs BUBBLE SORT
========================================

📊 Test Data Size: 500 vehicles

Bubble Sort O(n²): 2 ms
Quick Sort O(n log n): 0 ms
✅ Heap-based sorting provides O(n log n) performance!
✅ Essential for large-scale fleet management!


========================================
  BENCHMARK 4: SPACE-TIME TRADEOFF
========================================

Data Structure Analysis:

1. Hash Table:
   Time: O(1) search, insert, delete
   Space: O(n + table_size) - uses extra memory for buckets
   Trade-off: ✅ Fastest lookups, ❌ Higher memory usage

2. B-Tree (Sorted Array):
   Time: O(log n) search, O(n) insert
   Space: O(n) - compact storage
   Trade-off: ✅ Range queries, ✅ Memory efficient

3. Min Heap:
   Time: O(1) find-min, O(log n) insert/extract
   Space: O(n) - compact array representation
   Trade-off: ✅ Fast priority access, ✅ Efficient storage

4. LRU Cache:
   Time: O(1) get/put operations
   Space: O(cache_size) - fixed memory budget
   Trade-off: ✅ Ultra-fast, ✅ Bounded memory

5. Trie (Autocomplete):
   Time: O(m) where m = string length
   Space: O(ALPHABET_SIZE * n * m) - can be large
   Trade-off: ✅ Fast prefix search, ❌ Higher space

6. Graph + Dijkstra:
   Time: O(E log V) shortest path
   Space: O(V + E) adjacency list
   Trade-off: ✅ Optimal paths, ✅ Scalable


========================================
  ✅ ALL BENCHMARKS COMPLETED!
========================================

💡 Key Takeaways:
1. Hash Tables provide O(1) lookups - crucial for real-time systems
2. Binary Search reduces 10,000 comparisons to ~13
3. Heap-based sorting outperforms bubble sort significantly
4. Space-time tradeoffs guide DSA selection
5. Proper DSA choice impacts production performance!
